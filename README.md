# In-band OAM IETF DRAFTS

In-band OAM (or "in situ OAM") is an implementation study to record operational
information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points
in the network. In-band OAM is to complement current out-of-band OAM (sometimes
also called "active" OAM) mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe
packets.
