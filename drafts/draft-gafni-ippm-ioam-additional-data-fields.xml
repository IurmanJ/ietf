    <section title="Additional Data Fields ">
      <t>This draft extends <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> with
      additional data fields. The additional suggested data fields are: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Transmitted Bytes from an interface</t>

          <t>Speed of an interface</t>

          <t>Interface errors</t>
        </list>The addition of these new data fields is intended to help
      network operators to better manage their networks, where more data is
      requried with regards to the activity and quality of the network ports.
      For example, one framework that may take advantage of these new data
      fileds is HPCC, which is proposed at <xref
      target="I-D.pan-tsvwg-hpccplus"/>. This section discusses the
      needed ammendments to the IOAM Trace header and the format of
      the added data fields themselves.</t>

      <section title="IOAM Trace Option-Types Ammendments">
        <t>IOAM Trace Option-Types and their headers are defined in section
        4.4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. As shown in section
        4.4.1, the trace option header includes an IOAM-Trace-Type which is a
        "A 24-bit identifier which specifies which data types are used in this
        node data list". In order to extend <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/> it is required to allocate
        respective bits specifying the additional data fields to be added to
        the packet. This draft is asking for the allocation of additional 2
        bits: <list style="hanging">

            Bytes from an interface.</t>

              </figure> <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="tx_bytes:">4-octet unsigned integer field. This
                field indicates how many bytes have been transmitted from the
                egress interface the packet is going out from. Note that this field
                may wrap around. As an example, for a 100Gbps port this field
                may wrap around within less than 3 seconds.
                This field is usable to determine the amount of data going through 
                 the path a flow is going through. Following multiple packets traversing 
                 the same interface, together with a timestamp, allows a network operator 
                 operator to gauge the amount of traffic going through the interface in 
                 total and relative to the flow it tracks. This data in turn may help to 
                 better control the traffic and take decisions related to the performance 
                 of the flow and the network.

                <t hangText="interface_speed:">6 bits unsigned integer field. This
                field indicates the current operational speed of the interface. The
                procedure to allocate, manage and map the interface_speed values into
                the actual speed is beyond the scope of this document.
             This field is usable to detect whether a packet or a flow is going 
                 through a path which has enough capacity compared to the expectation 
                 of the operator. Changes in the speed of the connectivty may require 
                 changing routing decisions or troubleshooting the links under consideration. 
                 When an operator intends to take a decision about the amount of data 
                 to transmit per flow, this data is helpful as well to track.</t>

                <t hangText="interface_errors:">26 bits unsigned integer field.
                This field inciates how many errors, such as packet drops due
                to CRC errors, has been detected on the interface used to deliver
                the packet.
             This data is helpful to understand the risk associated with the packet 
                 or the flow it belongs to as it shows the quality of the interface 
                 it uses as part of its path in the network. It can also point out 
                 potential issues that other packets from the same flow might have 
                 experienced.
