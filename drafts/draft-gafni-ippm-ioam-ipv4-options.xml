    <section title="In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv4">
      <t>An IPv4 option is defined corresponding to each of the IOAM data
      fields defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. These
      mechanisms of in-situ OAM in IPv4 are used to enhance diagnostics of
      IPv4 networks. IOAM is carried in IPv4 packets as a new single option,
      with an option type identifier TBD_IOAM that will be defined by IANA,
      and according to the options definition in <xref target="RFC0791"/>.
      While specifying a new option to carry IOAM data, one may see this as an
      extension to the already defined "record route" and "internet timestamp"
      options in <xref target="RFC0791"/>, which allows a packet to record its
      route and collect timestamps throughout the network. The various IOAM
      data fields defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] are added as TLVs
      within the new IPv4 option. In an administrative domain where IOAM is
      used, insertion of the IOAM header in IPv4 is enabled at the IOAM domain
      edge, which serve as IOAM encapsulating/decapsulating nodes by means of
      configuration.</t>

      <section title="Considerations for in-situ OAM in IPv4 options">
        <t>In the scope of IPv4 header and its options in <xref
        target="RFC0791"/>, there are unique considerations for embedding
        in-situ OAM in the IPv4 options.</t>

        <section title="Alignment">
          <t>Within an IPv4 options stack there is no requirement for
          alignment outside the octet granularity, which doesn't limit the
          granularity of the in-situ OAM, since it is already 4-octects
          aligned.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Total available length">
          <t>There are three fields that may affect the total available length
          for in-situ OAM data to be incorporated in the IPv4 options: <list
              style="numbers">
              <t>The IPv4 header's IHL, as described in <xref
              target="RFC0791"/> in section 3.1: This 4-bit field can reach up
              to 15 times 4 octets, including the IPv4 header, which is 20
              octets. This leaves a maximum actual length of 40 octets to the
              options. Reducing 4 octets for the use of the option's header,
              it leaves 36 octets for the use of the in-situ OAM data. In the
              context of the trace type, which has an 8 octets header, this
              leaves 28 bytes for actual data to be collected during the
              packet's traverse through the network.</t>

              <t>The option's length, as described here above in section 3:
              This 8-bit field can reach up to 255 octets. Doesn't further
              restrict the in-situ OAM length, because of the above
              restrictions that are already applied.</t>

              <t>Datagram's Total length, as described in <xref
              target="RFC0791"/> in section 3.1: Doesn't further restrict the
              in-situ OAM length, because of the above restrictions that are
              already applied.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="Pre-allocation vs. Incremental trace types">
          <t>Considering the IPv4 architecture, and specifically the "record
          route" and "internet timestamp" options definitions, the RFC calls
          for "The size of the option does not change due to adding
          addresses...", and similarly for the timestamp option. Hence, while
          incorporating In-situ OAM trace type header, an implementation
          SHOULD use one of these two techniques: <list style="numbers">
              <t>Immediate Export mode, controlled by the I-bit as part of the
              trace flags.</t>

            <t>UDP's pseudo header, as described in <xref target="RFC0768"/>,
            doesn't include neither the IPv4 options nor the IHL, hence

        <section title="Fragmentation">
          <t>Considering the IPv4 architecture, and specifically the "record
          route" and "internet timestamp" options definitions, <xref
          target="RFC0791"/> is calling for setting the option's copy to zero,
          hence "Not copied on fragmentation, goes in first fragment only". It
          seems reasonable to the authors to keep this idea to prevent
          duplication of route data and maintain similar behavior for the
          operator, hence an implementer SHOULD follow this method.</t>

      case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described in defined
      in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>.</t>

      <t>As this document describes a new option for IPv4, that is similar in
      their behavior to an already existing options, the security
      considerations are similar as well to those of <xref
