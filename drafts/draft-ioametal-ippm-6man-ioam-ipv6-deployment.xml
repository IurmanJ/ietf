    <section anchor="v6_requirement"
             title="Considerations for IOAM deployment in IPv6 networks">
      <t>IOAM deployment in an IPv6 network should take the following
      considerations and requirements into account:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="C1">It is desireable that the addition of IOAM data
          fields neither changes the way routers forward the packets, nor the
          forwarding decision the routers takes. The packet with the added OAM
          information should follow the same path within the domain that the
          same packet without the OAM information would follow within the
          domain even in the presence of ECMP. Such a behavior is particularly
          interesting for deployments where IOAM data fields are only added
          "on-demand", e.g. to provide futher insights in case of undesired
          network behavior for certain flows. Implementations of IOAM should
          ensure that ECMP behavior for packets with and without IOAM data
          fields is the same.</t>

          <t hangText="C2">Given that IOAM data fields increase the total size
          of the packet, the packet size could exceed the PMTU. In particular,
          the incremental trace IOAM HbH Option, which is proposed to support
          hardware implementations of IOAM, changes Option Data Length
          en-route. Operators of an IOAM domain are to ensure that the
          addition of OAM information does not lead to fragmentation of the
          packet. Careful control of the MTU in a network is one of the
          reasons why IOAM is considered a domain specific feature, see also
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data"/>. In addition, the PMTU
          tolerance range in the IOAM domain should be identified (e.g.
          through configuration) and IOAM encapsulation operations and/or IOAM
          data field insertion (in case of incremental tracing) should not be
          performed if it exceeds the packet size beyond PMTU.</t>

          <t hangText="C3">Packets with IOAM data or associated ICMP errors,
          should not arrive at destinations which have no knowledge of IOAM.
          Consider using IOAM in a transit network: Misleading ICMP errors due
          to addition and/or presence of OAM data in the packet can confuse a
          source of the packet that did not insert the OAM information.</t>

          <t hangText="C4">OAM data leaks may affect the forwarding behavior
          and state of network elements outside an IOAM domain. Build a
          mechanism to prevent data leaks or be able to assure that upon leak
          network elements outside the domain are not affected i.e continue to
          process other valid packets.</t>

          <t hangText="C5">Source OAM domain that inserted and leaked OAM data
          must be easy to identify for purpose of troubleshooting. For e.g. It
          very time consuming to troubleshoot source that inserted the EH but
          didn't remove when the packet traverses across AS (you have to walk
          the AS path, contacting each operator, asking them to verify their
          config, get packet captures etc.), and all the while you may have a
          number of angry customers/end-users.</t>

          <t hangText="C6">Compliance with <xref target="RFC8200"/> would
          require OAM data to be encapsulated instead of header/option
          insertion into inflight packets.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="IOAM domains bounded by hosts">
      <t>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
      perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
      decapsulation. IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
      Destination options, see <xref
      target="I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IOAM domains bounded by network devices ">
      <t>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
      network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain. Network
      devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
      decapsulation.</t>

      <section title="Deployment options">
        <t>This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
        employed to meet the requirements listed in section <xref
        target="v6_requirement"/>.</t>

        <section title="IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation">
          <t>Leverage an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach: Preserve the original IP
          packet and add an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an
          extension header in front of it, to forward traffic within and
          across the IOAM domain. The overlay network formed by the additional
          IPv6 header with the IOAM data fields included in an extension
          header is referred to as IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this
          document. <list style="numbers">
              <t>Perform an IPv6-in-IPv6 approach. The source address of the
              outer IPv6 header is that of the IOAM encapsulating node. The
              desitination address of the outer IPv6 header is the same as the
              inner IPv6 destination address, i.e. the destination address of
              the packet does not change.</t>

              <t>To simplify debugging in case of leaked IOAM data fields in
              packets, consider a new IOAM E2E destination option to identify
              the Source IOAM domain (AS, v6 prefix). Insert this option into
              the IOAM destination options EH attached to the outer IPv6
              header. This additional information would allow for easy
              identification of an AS operator that is the source of packets
              with leaked IOAM information.</t>

              <t>All the IOAM options are defined with type "00 - skip over
              this option and continue processing the header. So presence of
              the options must not cause packet drop in the network elements
              that do not understand the option. In addition <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling"/> should be
              considered.</t>
            </list></t>
        </section>

        <section title="IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA">
          <t>The "IP-in-IPv6 encapsulation with ULA" approach can be used to
          apply IOAM to an IPv6 as well as an IPv4 network. In addition, it
          fulfills requirement C4 (avoid leaks) by using ULA for the ION.
          Similar to the IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation approach above, the
          original IP packet is preserved. An IPv6 header including IOAM data
          fields in an extension header is added in front of it, to forward
          traffic within and across the IOAM domain. IPv6 addresses for the
          ION, i.e. the outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA space.
          Addressing and routing in the ION are to be configured so that the
          IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the
          original, non-encapsulated packet would have taken.</t>

          <section title="Domain Interior Routes/Prefixes">
            <t>For each IP route/prefix interior to the IOAM domain (i.e.
            hosts have addresses from these prefixes) a corresponding /128
            route from the ION address space is allocated on every IOAM
            encapsulating/decapsulating router with the same metric and
            associated interface. When a host originated packet arrives at an
            IOAM encapsulating router, the destination address of the packet
            is looked up to find the corresponding /128 internal ION route.
            The encapsulating IOAM router imposes an IPv6 header on the packet
            and uses the retrieved /128 matching route as destination address.
            The IPv6 address of the encapsulating router is used as the source
            address. The encapsulating router also includes an IPv6 extension
            header to carry IOAM data fields, per <xref
            target="I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options"/>. The original
            IP packet follows the new IPv6 extension header without any
            modification. This means that the ION route/prefix can be
            understood as an internal routeable index or proxy for the
            destination address/prefix of the original packet.</t>
          </section>

          <section title="Example">
            <t>This examples assumes a network where routers X, Y, Z are part
            of an IOAM domain. Even though the example shows and IPv6 network,
            the concept equally applies to an IPv4 network.</t>

            <t>Router X has the following routes and metrics configured. Note
            that interface C has been configured with two different prefixes
            with different metrics.</t>

            <t>Based on the above configuration of prefixes on its interfaces,
            router X automatically generates and announces into the IGP (or
            BGP with no export community) matching ION internal /128s routes
            for each of them, using addresses from the ULA space mentioned
            above. This example uses fd1f:d2:feed::/48. The corresponding ION
            /128s for IOAM Router X's interfaces would be:</t>

              </figure>Note that the scheme to generate the ION /128 prefixes
            which match the global routes/prefixes is out of the scope of this
            document.</t>

            <t>When a packet enters the IOAM domain at IOAM Router Z, with a
            destination address that falls within 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 (Router
            X's interface A prefix), the outer tunnel header's destination
            address would be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128 (Router
            X's intf A: ION /128 prefix). This encapsulated packet should
            follow the same path through the IOAM domain that a packet
            destined towards 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 should, from IOAM Router Z
            to IOAM Router X, because 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 and
            fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128 prefixes have both the same origin router
            and the same path metrics.</t>

            <t>If another packet enters the IOAM domain at IOAM Router Z, with
            a destination address that falls within 2001:db8:0:4567::/64 (IOAM
            Router X intf C's second prefix), then the outer packet tunnel
            destination address would be the corresponding
            fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128 (Router X interface C's second and matching
            ION /128 prefix). As the metric for 2001:db8:0:4567::/64 and
            fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128 on Router X is 150, the path through the
            IOAM domain between IOAM Router Z and IOAM Router X for this
            packet could be different to the one taken in the previous
            example.</t>

            <t>For completeness, for a different Router Y, with a destination
            address that falls within 2001:db8:0:3456::/64 (Router X intf C's
            first prefix), then the outer packet tunnel destination address
            would be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::3456/128 (Router X intf
            C's first and matching ION /128 prefix).</t>

          <section title="Domain Exterior Routes/Prefixes">
            <t>For exterior routes, IPv6-in-IP tunnelling is used in a similar
            way. Transit across the ION follows the transit approach for
            traffic between BGP border routers, as described in RFC1772,
            "A.2.3 Encapsulation". In addition to the new IPv6 outer header,
            an IPv6 extension header carrying the IOAM data fields would be
            added.</t>
