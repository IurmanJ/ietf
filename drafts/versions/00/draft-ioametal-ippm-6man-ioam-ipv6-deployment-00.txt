1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options] defines how IOAM data
   fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200].  This document
   discusses deployment options for networks which leverage IOAM data
   fields encapsulated in the IPv6 protocol.

   Deployment considerations differ, whether the IOAM domain starts and
   ends on hosts or whether the IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   nodes are network devices that forward traffic, such as routers.

3.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options, see [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].

4.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

4.1.  Requirements

   R1 The packet with the added OAM information must follow the same
      path within the domain that the same packet without the OAM
      information would follow within the domain even in the presence of
      ECMP.

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation         January 2019


   R2 Dealing with PMTU - Packet size changes might exceed PMTU.
      Addition of OAM information must not lead to fragmentation of the
      packet.

   R3 Incremental Trace IOAM HbH Option - which is proposed to support a
      hardware implementations changes Option Data Len en-route.
      Dealing with PMTU- Packet size changes can exceed PMTU; see above.

   R4 Misleading ICMP errors due to addition and/or presence of OAM data
      in the packet can confuse the source of the packet that did not
      insert the OAM information

   R5 OAM data leaks may affect the forwarding behavior and state of
      network elements outside the domain.  Build a mechanism to prevent
      data leaks or be able to assure that upon leak network elements
      outside the domain are not affected i.e continue to process other
      valid packets.

   R6 Source OAM domain that inserted and leaked OAM data must be easy
      to identify for purpose of troubleshooting.  For e.g.  It very
      time consuming to troubleshoot source that inserted the EH but
      didn't remove when the packet traverses across AS (you have to
      walk the AS path, contacting each operator, asking them to verify
      their config, get packet captures etc.), and all the while you may
      have a number of angry customers/end-users

   R7 Compliance with [RFC8200] would require OAM data to be
      encapsulated instead of header/option insertion into inflight
      packets.

4.2.  Deployment options

   This section lists out possible deployment options that can be
   employed to meet the requirements listed in Section Section 4.1.

4.2.1.  Option - 1

   Leverage an IP-in-IPv6 approach: Preserve the original IP packet and
   add an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an extension header
   in front of it, to forward traffic within and across the IOAM domain.
   The overlay network formed by the additional IPv6 header with the
   IOAM data fields included in an extension header is referred to as
   IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this document.  IPv6 addresses for the
   ION, i.e. the outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA space.
   Addressing and routing in the ION are to be configured so that the
   IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the original,
   non-encapsulated packet would have taken.

4.2.1.1.  Domain Interior Routes/Prefixes

   For each IP route/prefix interior to the IOAM domain (i.e.  hosts
   have addresses from these prefixes) a corresponding /128 route from
   the ION address space is allocated on every IOAM encapsulating/
   decapsulating router with the same metric and associated interface.
   When a host originated packet arrives at an IOAM encapsulating
   router, the destination address of the packet is looked up to find
   the corresponding /128 internal ION route.  The encapsulating IOAM
   router imposes an IPv6 header on the packet and uses the retrieved
   /128 matching route as destination address.  The IPv6 address of the
   encapsulating router is used as the source address.  The
   encapsulating router also includes an IPv6 extension header to carry
   IOAM data fields, per [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].
   The original IP packet follows the new IPv6 extension header without
   any modification.  This means that the ION route/prefix can be
   understood as an internal routeable index or proxy for the
   destination address/prefix of the original packet.

4.2.1.2.  Example

   This examples assumes a network where routers X, Y, Z are part of an
   IOAM domain.  Even though the example shows and IPv6 network, the
   concept equally applies to an IPv4 network.

   Router X has the following routes and metrics configured.  Note that
   interface C has been configured with two different prefixes with
   different metrics.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Interface |  Route                                |   Metric  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     A     |  2001:db8:0:1234::/64                 |   10      |
   |     B     |  2001:db8:0:2345::/64                 |   40      |
   |     C     |  2001:db8:0:3456::/64                 |   100     |
   |     C     |  2001:db8:0:4567::/64                 |   150     |
   |     D     |  2001:db8:0:5678::/64                 |   10      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Based on the above configuration of prefixes on its interfaces,
   router X automatically generates and announces into the IGP (or BGP
   with no export community) matching ION internal /128s routes for each
   of them, using addresses from the ULA space mentioned above.  This
   example uses fd1f:d2:feed::/48.  The corresponding ION /128s for IOAM
   Router X's interfaces would be:

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation         January 2019


   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Interface |  Route                                |   Metric  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     A     |  fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128               |   10      |
   |     B     |  fd1f:d2:feed::2345/128               |   40      |
   |     C     |  fd1f:d2:feed::3456/128               |   100     |
   |     C     |  fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128               |   150     |
   |     D     |  fd1f:d2:feed::5678/128               |   10      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Note that the scheme to generate the ION /128 prefixes which match
   the global routes/prefixes is out of the scope of this document.

   When a packet enters the IOAM domain at IOAM Router Z, with a
   destination address that falls within 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 (Router
   X's interface A prefix), the outer tunnel header's destination
   address would be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128 (Router X's
   intf A: ION /128 prefix).  This encapsulated packet should follow the
   same path through the IOAM domain that a packet destined towards
   2001:db8:0:1234::/64 should, from IOAM Router Z to IOAM Router X,
   because 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 and fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128 prefixes have
   both the same origin router and the same path metrics.

   If another packet enters the IOAM domain at IOAM Router Z, with a
   destination address that falls within 2001:db8:0:4567::/64 (IOAM
   Router X intf C's second prefix), then the outer packet tunnel
   destination address would be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128
   (Router X interface C's second and matching ION /128 prefix).  As the
   metric for 2001:db8:0:4567::/64 and fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128 on Router
   X is 150, the path through the IOAM domain between IOAM Router Z and
   IOAM Router X for this packet could be different to the one taken in
   the previous example.

   For completeness, for a different Router Y, with a destination
   address that falls within 2001:db8:0:3456::/64 (Router X intf C's
   first prefix), then the outer packet tunnel destination address would
   be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::3456/128 (Router X intf C's first
   and matching ION /128 prefix).

4.2.1.3.  Domain Exterior Routes/Prefixes

   For exterior routes, IPv6-in-IP tunnelling is used in a similar way.
   Transit across the ION follows the transit approach for traffic
   between BGP border routers, as described in RFC1772, "A.2.3
   Encapsulation".  In addition to the new IPv6 outer header, an IPv6
   extension header carrying the IOAM data fields would be added.

4.2.2.  Option - 2

   1.  Perform IP-in-IPv6 approach with source changed to that of the
       IOAM encapsulating node but destination unchanged.

   2.  Define a new IOAM E2E destination option to identify the Source
       IOAM domain (AS, v6 prefix).  Insert this option into the IOAM
       destination options EH attached to the outer IPv6 header

   3.  Identify PATH MTU tolerance range in the IOAM domain and do not
       perform IOAM encapsulation operation if it exceeds the packet
       size beyond PMTU.

   4.  Modify the forwarding elements in the IOAM domain to perform ECMP
       calculation that match the original packet.

       A.  Option 1: Employ IOAM with immediate export flag to help
           quick look up of appropriate headers for ECMP calculation.

       B.  Option 2 : Based on additional fields in the outer header to
           match the ECMP hashing of the original packet.  E.g. flow
           label to carry original packets ECMP hash?

       C.  Option 3: Looking beyond IOAM header into the inner header

   5.  To deal with leaked packets containing IOAM :

       A.  All the IOAM options are defined with type "00 - skip over
           this option and continue processing the header.  So presence
           of the options must not cause packet drop in the network
           elements that do not understand the option.

       B.  Encourage adoption of [I-D.ietf-6man-hbh-header-handling]
