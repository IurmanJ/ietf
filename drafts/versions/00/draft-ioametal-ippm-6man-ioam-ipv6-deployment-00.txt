1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.
   [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options] defines how IOAM data
   fields are encapsulated in the IPv6 [RFC8200].  This document
   discusses deployment options for networks which leverage IOAM data
   fields encapsulated in the IPv6 protocol.

   Deployment considerations differ, whether the IOAM domain starts and
   ends on hosts or whether the IOAM encapsulating and decapsulating
   nodes are network devices that forward traffic, such as routers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IOAM encap in v6

   IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or Destination
   options.  One IPv6 Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options Type
   codepoint is assigned for IOAM.  Multiple options with the same
   Option Type MAY appear in the same Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination
   Options header, with varying content.  This mechanism of in-situ OAM
   in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.  It
   complements other mechanisms proposed to enhance diagnostics of IPv6
   networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].

   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destination Option format for carrying in-situ
   OAM data fields:

   Option Type:  8-bit identifier of the type of option.

   Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Reserved and
      Option Data field of this option, in octets.

   Reserved:  8-bit field MUST be set to zero upon transmission and
      ignored upon reception.

   Option Data:  Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific data.

   In-situ OAM Options are inserted as Option data as follows:

       Tracing option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is
       represented as a IPv6 option in hop by hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Type.

   2.  Incremental Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Incremental Tracing
       option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a
       IPv6 option in hop by hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Incremental Trace Option Type.

   3.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option in hop
       by hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM POT Option Type.

   4.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option in IPv6
       option in destination options extension header:

       Option Type:  000xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM E2E Option Type.

   All the in-situ OAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment
   requirements.  Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This
   ensures that 4 octet fields specified in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]
   such as transit delay are aligned at a multiple-of-4 offset from the
   start of the Hop-by-Hop Options header.  In addition, to maintain
   IPv6 extension header 8-octet alignment and avoid the need to add or
   remove padding at every hop, the Trace-Type for Incremental Tracing
   Option in IPv6 MUST be selected such that the IOAM node data length
   is a multiple of 8-octets.

4.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or
   Destination options, see [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].

5.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.

5.1.  Requirements

   o  have the packet with the added OAM information follow the same
      path within the domain that the same packet without the OAM
      information would follow within the domain would have taken.

   o  How do you deal with PMTU? - Packet size changes might exceed PMTU

   o  Incremental Trace IOAM HbH Option - which is to support a
      hardware-friendly implementation: Changes Option Data Len en-
      route.  Dealing with PMTU- Packet size changes can exceed PMTU;
      see above.

   o  Misleading ICMP errors confusing the source

   o  Possible leaks that affect the forwarding behavior and state of
      network elements outside the domain: have the Dest.  Addr. of the
      packet with the added OAM information only be valid within the OAM
      domain i.e. an "interior DA", so that if through failure the
      packet leaks, it isn't a valid DA on the Internet and will be
      dropped by, if nothing else earlier, an Internet router with a
      default free route table

   o  An additional one is that if you were are receiver of this outside
      of the domain because it as leaked, at the destination, after the
      packet as traversed a number of ASes over the Internet, there is
      nothing to identify the device/AS that inserted the EH.  Very time
      consuming to troubleshoot who inserted the EH but didn't remove it
      (you have to walk the AS path, contacting each operator, asking
      them to verify their config, get packet captures etc.), and all
      the while you may have a number of angry customers/end-users

   o  encapsulate rather than insert, because encapsulation would be
      simpler, and is the traditional way of adding information to PDUs
      across many decades and many protocols

5.2.  Approach

   Leverage an IP-in-IPv6 approach: Preserve the original IP packet and
   add an IPv6 header including IOAM data fields in an extension header
   in front of it, to forward traffic within and across the IOAM domain.
   The overlay network formed by the additional IPv6 header with the
   IOAM data fields included in an extension header is referred to as
   IOAM Overlay Network (ION) in this document.  IPv6 addresses for the
   ION, i.e. the outer IPv6 addresses are assigned from the ULA space.
   Addressing and routing in the ION are to be configured so that the
   IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the original,
   non-encapsulated packet would have taken.

5.3.  Domain Interior Routes/Prefixes

   For each IP route/prefix interior to the IOAM domain (i.e. hosts have
   addresses from these prefixes) a corresponding /128 route from the
   ION address space is allocated on every IOAM encapsulating/
   decapsulating router with the same metric and associated interface.
   When a host originated packet arrives at an IOAM encapsulating
   router, the destination address of the packet is looked up to find
   the corresponding /128 internal ION route.  The encapsulating IOAM
   router imposes an IPv6 header on the packet and uses the retrieved
   /128 matching route as destination address.  The IPv6 address of the
   encapsulating router is used as the source address.  The
   encapsulating router also includes an IPv6 extension header to carry
   IOAM data fields, per [I-D.ioametal-ippm-6man-ioam-ipv6-options].
   The original IP packet follows the new IPv6 extension header without
   any modification.  This means that the ION route/prefix can be
   understood as an internal routeable index or proxy for the
   destination address/prefix of the original packet.

5.4.  Example

   This examples assumes a network where routers X, Y, Z are part of an
   IOAM domain.  Even though the example shows and IPv6 network, the
   concept equally applies to an IPv4 network.

   Router X has the following routes and metrics configured.  Note that
   interface C has been configured with two different prefixes with
   different metrics.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Interface |  Route                                |   Metric  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     A     |  2001:db8:0:1234::/64                 |   10      |
   |     B     |  2001:db8:0:2345::/64                 |   40      |
   |     C     |  2001:db8:0:3456::/64                 |   100     |
   |     C     |  2001:db8:0:4567::/64                 |   150     |
   |     D     |  2001:db8:0:5678::/64                 |   10      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Based on the above configuration of prefixes on its interfaces,
   router X automatically generates and announces into the IGP (or BGP
   with no export community) matching ION internal /128s routes for each
   of them, using addresses from the ULA space mentioned above.  This
   example uses fd1f:d2:feed::/48.  The corresponding ION /128s for IOAM
   Router X's interfaces would be:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Interface |  Route                                |   Metric  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     A     |  fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128               |   10      |
   |     B     |  fd1f:d2:feed::2345/128               |   40      |
   |     C     |  fd1f:d2:feed::3456/128               |   100     |
   |     C     |  fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128               |   150     |
   |     D     |  fd1f:d2:feed::5678/128               |   10      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Note that the scheme to generate the ION /128 prefixes which match
   the global routes/prefixes is out of the scope of this document.

   When a packet enters the IOAM domain at IOAM Router Z, with a
   destination address that falls within 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 (Router
   X's interface A prefix), the outer tunnel header's destination
   address would be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128 (Router X's
   intf A: ION /128 prefix).  This encapsulated packet should follow the
   same path through the IOAM domain that a packet destined towards
   2001:db8:0:1234::/64 should, from IOAM Router Z to IOAM Router X,
   because 2001:db8:0:1234::/64 and fd1f:d2:feed::1234/128 prefixes have
   both the same origin router and the same path metrics.

   If another packet enters the IOAM domain at IOAM Router Z, with a
   destination address that falls within 2001:db8:0:4567::/64 (IOAM
   Router X intf C's second prefix), then the outer packet tunnel
   destination address would be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128
   (Router X interface C's second and matching ION /128 prefix).  As the
   metric for 2001:db8:0:4567::/64 and fd1f:d2:feed::4567/128 on Router
   X is 100, the path through the IOAM domain between IOAM Router Z and
   IOAM Router X for this packet could be different to the one taken in
   the previous example.

   For completeness, for a different Router Y, with a destination
   address that falls within 2001:db8:0:3456::/64 (Router X intf C's
   first prefix), then the outer packet tunnel destination address would
   be the corresponding fd1f:d2:feed::3456/128 (Router X intf C's first
   and matching ION /128 prefix).

5.5.  Domain Exterior Routes/Prefixes

   For exterior routes, IPv6-in-IP tunnelling is used in a similar way.
   Transit across the ION follows the transit approach for traffic
   between BGP border routers, as described in RFC1772, "A.2.3
   Encapsulation".  In addition to the new IPv6 outer header, an IPv6
   extension header carrying the IOAM data fields would be added.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described in
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6 , these are similar
   to the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the new weakness
   documented in [RFC8250].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignments from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters.
