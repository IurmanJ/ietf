 1.  Introduction
 
    This document defines data record types for "in-band" operation,
    administration, and maintenance (OAM).  In-band OAM records OAM
    information within the packet while the packet traverses a particular
    network domain.  The term "in-band" refers to the fact that the OAM
    data is added to the data packets rather than is being sent within
    packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of the
    motivation and requirements for in-band OAM can be found in

    complement "out-of-band" or "active" mechanisms such as ping or
    traceroute, or more recent active probing mechanisms as described in
    [I-D.lapukhov-dataplane-probe].  In-band OAM mechanisms can be
    leveraged where current out-of-band mechanisms do not apply or do not
    offer the desired results, such as proving that a certain set of
    traffic takes a pre-defined path, SLA verification for the live data
    traffic, detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths in
    networks that distribute traffic across multiple paths, or scenarios
    where probe traffic is potentially handled differently from regular
    data traffic by the network devices.

 3.  In-band OAM Data Types and Data Format
 
    This section defines in-band OAM data types and data formats of the
    data records required for in-band OAM.  The different uses of in-band
    OAM require the definition of different types of data.  The in-band
    OAM data format for the data being carried corresponds to the three
    main categories of in-band OAM data defined in
-   [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements], which are edge-to-edge,
-   per node, and for selected nodes only.

    Transport options for in-band OAM data are found in

-   as options in Type-Length-Value (TLV) format.  The TLV format for

    In-band OAM is expected to be deployed in a specific domain rather
    than on the overall Internet.  The part of the network which employs
    in-band OAM is referred to as "in-band OAM-domain".  In-band OAM data
    is added to a packet on entering the in-band OAM-domain and is
    removed from the packet when exiting the domain.  Within the in-band
    OAM-domain, the in-band OAM data may be updated by network nodes that
    the packet traverses.  The device which adds in-band OAM data to the
    packet is called the "in-band OAM encapsulating node", whereas the
    device which removed the in-band OAM data is referred to as the "in-
