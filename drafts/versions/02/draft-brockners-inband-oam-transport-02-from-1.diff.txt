 Abstract
 
    In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
    traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-band OAM is
    to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or
    other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-band OAM
    data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
    Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension header), and IPv4.

 1.  Introduction
 
    This document discusses transport mechanisms for "in-band" operation,
    administration, and maintenance (OAM) data records.  In-band OAM
    records OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses
    a particular network domain.  The term "in-band" refers to the fact
    that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than is being
    sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of
    the motivation and requirements for in-band OAM can be found in

    This mechanisms of in-band OAM in IPv6 complement others proposed to
    enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance
    and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option described in
    [I-D.ietf-ippm-6man-pdm-option].  The IP Performance and Diagnostic
    Metrics Destination Option is destination focused and specific to
    IPv6, whereas in-band OAM is performed between end-points of the
    network or a network domain where it is enabled and used.

    With IPv6 now being generally deployed and new concepts such as
    Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] being introduced,
    it is imperative to further mature the operations, administration,
    and maintenance mechanisms available to IPv6 networks.
 
    The in-band OAM options translate into options for an IPv6 extension
    header.  The extension header would be inserted by either a host
    source of the packet, or by a transit/domain-edge node.
