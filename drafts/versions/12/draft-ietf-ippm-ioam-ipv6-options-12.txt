1.  Introduction

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  IOAM concepts
   and associated nomenclature, as well as IOAM data fields are defined
   in [RFC9197].  This document outlines how IOAM data fields are
   encapsulated in IPv6 [RFC8200] and discusses deployment requirements
   for networks that use IPv6-encapsulated IOAM data fields.

   The terms "encapsulation" and "decapsulation" are used in this
   document in the same way as in [RFC9197]: An IOAM encapsulating node
   incorporates one or more IOAM-Option-Types into packets.  An IOAM
   decapsulating node removes IOAM-Option-Type(s) from packets.

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   IOAM in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.  It
   complements other mechanisms designed to enhance diagnostics of IPv6
   networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].

   At the time this document was written, several implementations of
   IOAM for IPv6 exist, e.g., IOAM for IPv6 in the Linux Kernel
   (supported from Kernel version 5.15 onwards IPv6 IOAM in Linux Kernel
   (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/
   commit/7c804e91df523a37c29e183ea2b10ac73c3a4f3d)), IOAM for IPv6 in
   VPP (https://docs.fd.io/vpp/17.04/ioam_ipv6_doc.html).

   IOAM data fields can be encapsulated with two types of extension
   headers in IPv6 packets - either the hop-by-hop options header or the
   destination options header.  Multiple options with the same option
   type MAY appear in the same hop-by-hop options or destination options
   header, with distinct content.

   An IPv6 packet carrying IOAM data in an extension header can have
   other extension headers, compliant with [RFC8200].

   IPv6 hop-by-hop and destination option format for carrying IOAM data
   fields:

   Option Type:  8-bit option type identifier as defined in Section 6.

   Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of this option, in
      octets, not including the first 2 octets.

   Reserved:  8-bit field MUST be set to zero by the source.

   IOAM-Option-Type:  Abbreviated to "IOAM-Opt-Type" in the diagram
      above: 8-bit field as defined in section 4.1 of [RFC9197].

   Option Data:  Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific data.

   IOAM Option data is inserted as follows:

   1.  Pre-allocated Trace Option: The IOAM Preallocated Trace Option-
       Type defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC9197] is represented as an
       IPv6 option in the hop-by-hop extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_1 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option-Type.

   2.  Proof of Transit Option: The IOAM POT Option-Type defined in
       Section 4.5 of [RFC9197] is represented as an IPv6 option in the
       hop-by-hop extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_1 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM POT Option-Type.

   3.  Edge to Edge Option: The IOAM E2E option defined in Section 4.6
       [RFC9197] is represented as an IPv6 option in destination
       extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_0 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM E2E Option-Type.

   4.  Direct Export (DEX) Option: The IOAM Direct Export Option-Type
       defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9326] is represented as an IPv6
       option in the hop-by-hop extension header:

       Option Type:  TBD_1_0 8-bit identifier of the IPv6 Option Type
          for IOAM.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Direct Export (DEX) Option-Type.

   All the IOAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment requirements.
   Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This ensures that
   fields specified in [RFC9197] are aligned at a multiple-of-4 offset
   from the start of the hop-by-hop and destination options header.

   IPv6 options can have a maximum length of 255 octets.  Consequently,
   the total length of IOAM Option-Types including all data fields is
   also limited to 255 octets when encapsulated into IPv6.

4.  IOAM Deployment In IPv6 Networks


4.1.  Considerations for IOAM deployment and implementation in IPv6
      networks

   IOAM deployments in IPv6 networks MUST take the following
   considerations and requirements into account:

   C1  IOAM MUST be deployed in an IOAM-Domain.  An IOAM-Domain is a set
      of nodes that use IOAM.  An IOAM-Domain is bounded by its
      perimeter or edge.  The set of nodes forming an IOAM-Domain may be
      connected to the same physical infrastructure (e.g., a service
      provider's network).  They may also be remotely connected to each
      other (e.g., an enterprise VPN or an overlay).  It is expected
      that all nodes in an IOAM-Domain are managed by the same
      administrative entity.  Please refer to [RFC9197]) for more
      details on IOAM-Domains.

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation             May 2023


   C2  Implementations of IOAM MUST ensure that the addition of IOAM
      data fields does not alter the way routers forward packets or the
      forwarding decisions they make.  Packets with added IOAM
      information must follow the same path within the domain as an
      identical packet without IOAM information would, even in the
      presence of Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP).  This behavior is
      important for deployments where IOAM data fields are only added
      "on-demand".  Implementations of IOAM MUST ensure that ECMP
      behavior for packets with and without IOAM data fields is the
      same.  In order for IOAM to work in IPv6 networks, IOAM MUST be
      explicitly enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM
      domain.  Unless a particular interface is explicitly enabled
      (i.e., explicitly configured) for IOAM, a router MUST ignore IOAM
      Options.

   C3  In order to maintain the integrity of packets in an IOAM domain,
      the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of transit routers and
      switches must be configured to a value that does not lead to an
      ICMP Packet Too Big error message being sent to the originator and
      the packet being dropped.  The PMTU tolerance range must be
      identified and IOAM encapsulation operations or data field
      insertion must not exceed this range.  Control of the MTU is
      critical to the proper operation of IOAM.  The PMTU tolerance must
      be identified through configuration and IOAM operations must not
      exceed the packet size beyond PMTU.

   C4  [RFC8200] precludes insertion of IOAM data directly into the
      original IPv6 header of in-flight packets.  IOAM deployments which
      do not encapsulate/decapsulate IOAM on the host but desire to
      encapsulate/decapsulate IOAM on transit nodes MUST add an
      additional IPv6 header to the original packet.  IOAM data is added
      to this additional IPv6 header.

4.2.  IOAM domains bounded by hosts

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will
   perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and
   decapsulation, i.e., hosts will place the IOAM data fields directly
   in the IPv6 header or remove the IOAM data fields directly from the
   IPv6 header.  IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as hop-by-hop or
   destination options as specified in this document.

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation             May 2023


4.3.  IOAM domains bounded by network devices

   For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices,
   network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.
   Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field
   encapsulation and decapsulation.  Network devices will encapsulate
   IOAM data fields in an additional, outer, IPv6 header which carries
   the IOAM data fields.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  For general IOAM security considerations, see [RFC9197].
   Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for each
   case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are also described and
   defined in [RFC9197].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6, the security
   considerations of [RFC8200] and [RFC8250] apply.

   From a network-protection perspective, there is an assumed trust
   model such that any node that adds IOAM to a packet, removes IOAM
   from a packet, or modifies IOAM data fields of a packet is assumed to
   be allowed to do so.  By default, packets that include IPv6 extension
   headers with IOAM information MUST NOT be leaked through the
   boundaries of the IOAM-Domain.

   IOAM-Domain boundary routers MUST filter any incoming traffic from
   outside the IOAM-Domain that contains IPv6 extension headers with
   IOAM information.  IOAM-Domain boundary routers MUST also filter any
   outgoing traffic leaving the IOAM-Domain that contains IPv6 extension
   headers with IOAM information.

   In the general case, an IOAM node only adds, removes, or modifies an
   IPv6 extension header with IOAM information, if the directive to do
   so comes from a trusted source and the directive is validated.

   Problems may occur if the above behaviors are not implemented or if
   the assumed trust model is violated (e.g., through a security
   breach).  In addition to the security considerations discussed in
   [RFC9197], the security considerations associated with IPv6 extension
   headers listed in [RFC9098] apply.

5.1.  Applicability of AH

   The network devices in an IOAM-Domain are trusted to add, update and
   remove IOAM options according to the constraints specified in
   [RFC8200].  IOAM domain does not rely on the Authentication Header
   (AH) as defined in [RFC4302] to secure IOAM options.  The use of IOAM
   options with AH and its processing is not defined in this document.
   Future documents may define the use of IOAM with AH and its
   processing.
