 Abstract
 
    In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
    traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document
    discusses the data types and data formats for in-band OAM data
    records.  In-band OAM data records can be embedded into a variety of
    transports such as NSH, Segment Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via
    extension header), or IPv4.  In-band OAM is to complement current
