Section 1., paragraph 1:
EXPLANATION: 

OLD:

    This document defines data record types for "in-band" operation,
    administration, and maintenance (OAM).  In-band OAM records OAM
    information within the packet while the packet traverses a particular
    network domain.  The term "in-band" refers to the fact that the OAM
    data is added to the data packets rather than is being sent within
    packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of the
    motivation and requirements for in-band OAM can be found in
|   [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  In-band OAM is to
    complement "out-of-band" or "active" mechanisms such as ping or
    traceroute, or more recent active probing mechanisms as described in
    [I-D.lapukhov-dataplane-probe].  In-band OAM mechanisms can be
    leveraged where current out-of-band mechanisms do not apply or do not
    offer the desired results, such as proving that a certain set of
    traffic takes a pre-defined path, SLA verification for the live data
    traffic, detailed statistics on traffic distribution paths in
    networks that distribute traffic across multiple paths, or scenarios
    where probe traffic is potentially handled differently from regular
    data traffic by the network devices.

Section 3., paragraph 1:
EXPLANATION: 

OLD:

    This section defines in-band OAM data types and data formats of the
    data records required for in-band OAM.  The different uses of in-band
    OAM require the definition of different types of data.  The in-band
    OAM data format for the data being carried corresponds to the three
    main categories of in-band OAM data defined in
|   [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements], which are edge-to-edge,
|   per node, and for selected nodes only.

    Transport options for in-band OAM data are found in

|   as options in Type-Length-Value (TLV) format.  The TLV format for
|   each of the three different types of in-band OAM data is defined in
|   this document.
