 Abstract
 
    In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
    traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-band OAM is
    to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or
    other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-band OAM
    data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
    Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension header), and IPv4.
