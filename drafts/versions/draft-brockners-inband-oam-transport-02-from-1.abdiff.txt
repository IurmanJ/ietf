Section 1., paragraph 1:
EXPLANATION: 

OLD:

    This document discusses transport mechanisms for "in-band" operation,
    administration, and maintenance (OAM) data records.  In-band OAM
    records OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses
    a particular network domain.  The term "in-band" refers to the fact
    that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than is being
    sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A discussion of
    the motivation and requirements for in-band OAM can be found in
|   [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  Data types and data
|   formats for in-band OAM are defined in
|   [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data].

    This document outlines transport encapsulations for the in-band OAM
|   data defined in [draft-brockners-inband-oam-data].  This document is
|   to serve informational purposes only.  As part of an in-band OAM
    implementation study different protocol encapsulations for in-band
    OAM data are being explored.  Once data formats and encapsulation
    approaches are settled, protocol specific specifications for in-band
    OAM data transport will address the standardization aspect.

Section 3., paragraph 2:
EXPLANATION: 

OLD:

    A historical note: The idea of IPv6 route recording was originally
|   introduced by [draft-kitamura-ipv6-record-route] back in year 2000.
    With IPv6 now being generally deployed and new concepts such as
    Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] being introduced,
    it is imperative to further mature the operations, administration,
    and maintenance mechanisms available to IPv6 networks.

EXPLANATION:

    are encoded with an option type allocated in the new in-band OAM IANA
    registry - in-band OAM_PROTOCOL_OPTION_REGISTRY_IANA_TBD.  In
    addition the following padding options are defined to be used when
    necessary to align subsequent options and to pad out the containing
    header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.

Section 5., paragraph 1:
EXPLANATION: 

OLD:

    In Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665], the Network Service
    Header (NSH) [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] already includes path tracing
    capabilities [I-D.penno-sfc-trace], but currently does not offer a
    solution to securely prove that packets really traversed the service
    chain.  The "Proof of Transit" capabilities (see
|   [draft-brockners-inband-oam-requirements] and
|   [draft-brockners-proof-of-transit]) of in-band OAM can be leveraged
    within NSH.  Proof of transit in-band OAM data is added as NSH Type 2
    metadata:
